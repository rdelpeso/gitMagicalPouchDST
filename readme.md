Branching guidelines:

Notes:  
\- when creating a new feature, create a new branch 'feature-\*' using 'develop' as the starting point;  
\- when a feature is almost ready it is merged into 'develop'; after being successfully tested, 'develop' is merged into 'master'; if there were big enough changes a new branch 'release-\*' is also be created;  
\- 'hotfix-\*' is merged into 'master' when ready;
